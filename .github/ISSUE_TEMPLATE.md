#### Are you looking for help?

Reminder: The issue tracker is not a support forum.

Issues should only be filed in this project once they are able to be reproduced
and confirmed as a flaw in the software or incorrect information in associated
documentation.

If you are encountering problems integrating this module into your application,
please post a question on the [discussion forum](https://github.com/jaredhanson/oauth2orize-discuss)

#### Is this a security issue?

Do not open issues that might have security implications.  Potential security
vulnerabilities should be reported privately to jaredhanson@gmail.com.  Once any
